Link:->  ```https://github.com/zecollokaris/Meraki```
    

* You Will Need to have **Microsoft Window** installed on your device.

    -Microsoft Windows is a group of several ***graphical operating system*** families, all of which are developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft.

    -This is because the game engine is currently available on Microsoft Windows.


*  You need to install **Unity game engine**

    -Unity is, in short, a closed-source, cross-platform game development application. You create your game by manipulating objects in 3D and attaching various components to them. Even 2D games must be manipulated in 2D/3D. Scripts are written in C# (recommended), Boo or UnityScript.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED.

1. **Unity Game Engine.**

    -This is the engine used to create the scripts that held the game together including the game physics of the game such as gravity.

2. **Adobe Photoshop.**

    -Used to design character animations and style the character.

3. **Adobe Illustrator.**

    -Used to design game environment especially how the nature around was postioned.

4. **C Sharp (programming language).**

    -C# is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.

    -This is because Unity recommends scripts to be written in C#.
